## Need:  
- We have observed that most of the time we don‚Äôt have medicines when we need it the most. 
- Also, all chemist shops are not day and night, so if a person needs urgent medicine at midnight then they have to wait till morning.
- To solve this problem, we have come up with this solution.


## Working:
- All available medicines will be displayed with its cost on the Touch Screen LCD.
- The customer has to select the medicine which is available along with its quantity.
- The system will automatically calculate the total cost which will be displayed on the screen.
- The customer has to tap the RFID card on the sensor and the system will deducted the amount from card and it will be updated on the database. 
- Then system will drop the required medicine or supplies via dispensing mechanism and then the controller will update the inventory.
